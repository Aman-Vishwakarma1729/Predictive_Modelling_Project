# Predictive_Modelling_Project

This repository contains the code and resources for two predictive modeling problems. The problems are as follows:

## Problem 1: Linear Regression

### Dataset
The `comp-activ` dataset is a collection of computer system activity measures. It was collected from a Sun Sparcstation 20/712 with 128 Mbytes of memory running in a multi-user university department. Users performed a variety of tasks, including accessing the internet, editing files, and running CPU-bound programs.

### Objective
The goal of this project is to build a linear regression model to predict the 'usr' (portion of time (%) that CPUs run in user mode) and to understand how each attribute affects the system to be in 'usr' mode.

### Files
- `Project_5.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for solving Problem 1.
- `comp-activ.csv`: Dataset used for the analysis.
- `Report.pdf`: A report summarizing the findings and insights from the linear regression analysis.

## Problem 2: Logistic Regression, LDA, and CART

### Dataset
The dataset contains information on 1473 married females from a Contraceptive Prevalence Survey conducted in the Republic of Indonesia. The samples are married women who were either not pregnant or did not know if they were at the time of the survey.

### Objective
The objective of this project is to predict whether these women use a contraceptive method of choice based on their demographic and socio-economic characteristics. Three different algorithms, Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Classification and Regression Trees (CART), are used for modeling.

### Files
- `logistic_lda_cart.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for solving Problem 2.
- `contraceptive_survey.csv`: Dataset used for the analysis.
- `business_report.pdf`: A report summarizing the findings and insights from the logistic regression, LDA, and CART analysis.

## Usage
You can run the Jupyter notebooks to reproduce the analyses for both problems. The datasets are included for reference. The business reports provide detailed explanations of the results and insights.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the respective Jupyter Notebook (`linear_regression.ipynb` or `logistic_lda_cart.ipynb`) using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebooks to run the code and reproduce the analyses.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You can install them using pip:
